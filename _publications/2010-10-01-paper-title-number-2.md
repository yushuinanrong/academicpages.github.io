title: "Privacy-preserving, indoor occupant localization using a network of single-pixel sensors"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2017-01
excerpt: 'We propose an approach to indoor occupant localization using a network of single-pixel, visible-light sensors. In addition to preserving privacy, our approach vastly reduces data transmission rate and is agnostic to eavesdropping. We develop two purely data-driven localization algorithms and study their performance using a network of 6 such sensors. In one algorithm, we divide the monitored floor area (2.37m×2.72m) into a 3×3 grid of cells and classify location of a single person as belonging to one of the 9 cells using a support vector machine classifier. In the second algorithm, we estimate person's coordinates using support vector regression. In cross-validation tests in public (e.g., conference room) and private (e.g., home) scenarios, we obtain 67-72% correct classification rate for cells and 0.31-0.35m mean absolute distance error within the monitored space. Given the simplicity of sensors and processing, these are encouraging results and can lead to useful applications today.'

title: "Estimating head pose orientation using extremely low resolution images"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-01
excerpt: 'The estimation of human head pose is of interest in some surveillance and human-computer interaction scenarios. Traditionally, this is not a difficult task if high- or even standard-definition video cameras are used. However, such cameras cannot be used in scenarios requiring privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a non-linear regression method for the estimation of human head pose from extremely low resolution images captured by a monocular RGB camera. We evaluate the common histogram of oriented gradients (HoG) feature, propose a new gradient-based feature, and use Support Vector Regression (SVR) to estimate head pose. We evaluate our algorithm on the Biwi Kinect Head Pose Dataset by re-sizing full-resolution RGB images to extremely low resolutions. The results are promising. At 10×10-pixel resolution, we achieve 6.95, 9.92 and 12.88 degree mean-absolute errors (MAE) for roll, yaw and pitch angles, respectively. These errors are very close to state-of-the-art results for full-resolution images.'
