permalink: /publication/2017-01
excerpt: 'We propose an approach to indoor occupant localization using a network of single-pixel, visible-light sensors. In addition to preserving privacy, our approach vastly reduces data transmission rate and is agnostic to eavesdropping. We develop two purely data-driven localization algorithms and study their performance using a network of 6 such sensors. In one algorithm, we divide the monitored floor area (2.37m×2.72m) into a 3×3 grid of cells and classify location of a single person as belonging to one of the 9 cells using a support vector machine classifier. In the second algorithm, we estimate person's coordinates using support vector regression. In cross-validation tests in public (e.g., conference room) and private (e.g., home) scenarios, we obtain 67-72% correct classification rate for cells and 0.31-0.35m mean absolute distance error within the monitored space. Given the simplicity of sensors and processing, these are encouraging results and can lead to useful applications today.'
